Task 1: Revisit Scala Homework

Overview 
We want to count the number of distinct triangles in the Twitter graph or a social amplifier pattern. A triangle (X, Y, Z) is a triple of user IDs, such that there exist three edges (X, Y), (Y, Z), and (Z, X). We will solve this problem with RS-join and Rep-join in Spark Scala with RDD and DSET.

Task 2: Full Page Rank

Overview: 
We ran Full PageRank on the input to find out the 100 most popular users(whoever has the highest PageRank) Since the user with the highest PageRank will have the most inlinks, it means that he/she is the most popular or the easiest to find in the network.

Task 3: Classification and prediction in Spark MLlib
Overview:  
We are predicting the fare amount for a taxi ride in New York City given pickup and dropiff locations.
